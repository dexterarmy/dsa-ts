1. look for worst case complexity , you can also optimize the best case as well
2. we don't care about what the actual time taken is, we only care about the relationship , how the line is growing
3. we can derive the complexity of any equation
4. constant is the best one
5. expression is a value , func and class are both expression and statement
6. big-oh -> our algo will not exceed the complexity of this
7. tight bound
