1. func calling another func
2. body and definition of func is same, doing the same thing
3. function execution happens in stack, when it finishes executing it is popped off stack and flow of prog is restored to where that func was called
4. Same name, body, parameter, 
5. Func def -> block of code executed when called with parameter
6. Func that calls itself
7. Every func call takes memory
8. Stack overflow error
9. Can convert any recursion func to iteration, sometimes more optimized results
10. Find the nth number -> recursion
11. Any recursive solution, you can convert into a formula
12. Understand how func calls are getting into stack
13. in linear recurrence relation -> repeated function calls (we can solve this problem with the help of dynamic programming)
14. DP -> if in a recursion call , two or more recursion calls are doing the same work , don't compute it again and again
15. whenever calling a recursion call, make sure you are returning it if there is a return type
16. you will not understand recursion if you don't run it on pen and paper and debug it yourself
